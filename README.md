# Flood It

A simple game made in Java.

The objective of the game is to "flood" the window with a single color.

The game is played from top-left corner.
When the color is changed, all squares touching the "main" shape that are the same color get connected.

Change the color by clicking on any colored squares.

# How to run

Since this is Java, you need to have java installed.

Then simply run the main class file.

> java Main

GUI tested on Ubuntu Linux & Windows.

Feel free to dissect the awful code.
